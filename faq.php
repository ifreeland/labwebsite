                            <li><h4>What are batting cages?</h4>
                                Each of our four indoor batting cages is 60 feet long and includes a pitching machine, L-screen, and tee. Use them for fun with friends and family, parties, birthdays, training sessions, work events, and more!

                            <li><h4>What pitching machines do you use?</h4>
                                At The LAB 406, we use Hack Attack Baseball and Softball Pitching Machines—high-performance machines that make your visit feel like the real deal. Whether you're here for fun with friends, a party, or a unique date idea, these machines deliver fast, exciting, and super satisfying pitches.
                                <br>They can throw fastballs, curveballs, sliders, and more, and we offer both automatic and manual feeding options—so you can go hands-free or take turns tossing balls to each other. With a smooth, realistic pitch delivery and speeds up to 100+ MPH (don’t worry, we can tone it down!), the Hack Attack machines make batting cage time way more fun and way less boring.

                            <li><h4>Are batting cages fun?</h4>
                                Definitely! Batting cages are an exciting way to stay active and have fun—kind of like going bowling or playing mini golf, but with a lot more swings!

                            <li><h4>Are batting cages a good exercise?</h4>
                                Absolutely. Swinging in the cage is a great workout that builds explosive power, improves balance, and boosts stamina.

                            <li><h4>Are batting cages bad for bats?</h4>
                                Pitching machines can shorten a bat’s lifespan, but high-quality bats are designed to handle the impact better. To protect your gear, The LAB 406 offers rental equipment so you don’t have to risk damaging your own bat.

                            <li><h4>Are batting cages safe?</h4>
                                Batting cages have some risks, like any activity. To reduce them, always follow instructions, wear proper gear like a helmet, and stay aware of your surroundings.
