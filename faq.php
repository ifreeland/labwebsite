                            <li><h4>Are batting cages bad for bats?</h4>
                                Pitching machines can wear down the lifespan of a bat; however, high quality bats are built to have more shock absorbance, making them more durable for the machine balls! The Lab 406 offers rentable equipment to utilize and avoid any bat damage!</li>

                            <li><h4>Are batting cages dangerous?</h4>
                                Batting cages can be safe if proper precautions are taken, but like any activity, they do carry some risks. To stay safe, always follow safety instructions, wear appropriate gear (like a helmet), and be mindful of your surroundings.</li>
